# Inspirations

This was our second large project for NSS evening cohort 13. Our task was to create a one page chat app with a team of 4 people. As a group, we chose the theme of our chat application (dragonflies) and how to implement our user interface tickets. As a group, we wanted to create a unique chatting application for our users that would allow them to choose their own identity to past as.
